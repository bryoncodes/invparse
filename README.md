# invparse
A simple inventory parser.

Reads JSON data from stdin, prints to stdout the answers to the following questions:
- What are the 5 most expensive items from each category?
- Which cds have a total running time longer than 60 minutes?
- Which authors have also released cds?
- Which items have a title, track, or chapter that contains a year?
